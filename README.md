### **Brief Bio**
I grew up in the Cuyahoga Valley National Park area. I like to climb, code, and lift whenever I can.  I used to work at the outdoor adventure center here on campus, so there’s a chance you’ve climbed one of my routes. Beyond those, though, you’ll probably find me with my earbuds in. I’m usually listening to either “10 Hour Box Fan (No Distractions)” from Big Fan or whatever artist I’m stuck in. Currently, those are: FKA Twigs, Maggie Rogers, and Wolf Alice.  

I had a rather. . . colorful path to choosing chemical engineering. After dancing around between almost 4 majors my freshman/sophomore years (even double majoring between some of them at points), I landed on chemical engineering because of the support I felt from the department. For better or worse, I’ve extended this explorative trend to my experiences.

### **Broad Research Interests, Beliefs, & Goals**
I'm generally interested in biological optimizations for sustainable energy and healthcare. I believe innovation lies behind behind fewer, smarter experiements rather than exhaustive campaings for more figures. More importaintly, however, I believe anyone, regardless of background, can be a scientist or engineer. To this end, I hope to one day lead a research group at an R1 university.
